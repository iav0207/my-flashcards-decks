# My flashcard decks

After tinycards closure I realized that I need a more persistent storage for my decks to not lose over a thousand words I've been collecting.

Here's this storage.

## Contents

- [duolingo](./duolingo) is a full data export from my Duolingo account containing tinycards decks in a weird format
- [tinyconvert](./tinyconvert) is a script I ran to convert tinycards decks into a format that made more sense to me and which can be used to convert into whatever else to import the cards into another service
- [flashcards](./flashcards) the flashcards themselves, grouped in decks of under 150 cards each, initially built by the tinyconvert script
